HeaderPage.java> selectACity(city)
PageBase.java> selectCity(city)


Wrote a new definition for selectCity(city) in PageBase.java. Had many selectCity() functions. Will be deleting all of them soon. Sole purpose is to not
keep writing repetitive code. This new method handles the change we are seeing in the homepage.

Also since non-responsive homepages no longer exists in quikr.com,
while using letsLogin(), pass in arguments corresponding to responsive page login.

Adil
